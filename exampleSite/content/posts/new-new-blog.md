5. **Organizing Content**: I arranged my content into Hugo's directory structure.

6. **Customizing Configuration**: I customized the Hugo configuration to personalize my blog.

7. **Testing Locally**: I tested my Hugo site locally to iron out any issues.

8. **Deploying**: Once satisfied, I deployed my Hugo blog to my hosting provider.
