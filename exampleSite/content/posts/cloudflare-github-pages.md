# My Experience with Using Cloudflare and GitHub Pages

I recently decided to enhance my website's performance and security by putting Cloudflare in front of my GitHub Pages site. It was a game-changer!

With Cloudflare acting as a reverse proxy, my content gets cached and distributed globally through its powerful CDN. The result? Lightning-fast load times for my visitors, regardless of their location.

Moreover, Cloudflare's robust DDoS protection and security features give me peace of mind, keeping my GitHub Pages site safe from potential threats.

Setting up Cloudflare with GitHub Pages was a breeze. Just a few simple steps, and I was able to enjoy Cloudflare's performance and security enhancements while keeping the convenience of hosting my static site on GitHub Pages.

If you're looking to supercharge your website, I highly recommend pairing Cloudflare with GitHub Pages for an exceptional user experience.
