If so, then this might be the perfect theme for you!

So you might ask, what makes this theme so special?

- Some themes have summaries on the main page, you probably don't have time to write a long post anyway so there is none of that, just the links.
- Like summaries, most themes have some sort of pagination but that isn't necessary here
- Limited use of dates next to articles because it's probably not something you want to highlight.
- Only uses semantic html tags, so yeah, it is pretty modern.
- Maybe you like social media icons? Nothing like that here, so if you like that stuff this is probably not the theme for you.
- Uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) as the main font.
- RSS feed shows the full article
