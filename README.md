# One post a year

The one-post-a-year theme is an extremely lightweight theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It's built with simplicity and speed in mind.

Are you starting a tech blog that will probably have posts like this?

Then this might be the perfect theme for you! What makes this theme so special?

- Some themes have summaries on the main page, you probably don't have time to write a long post anyway so the main page doesn't bother
- Dates are nice, but pretty much useless if you have only a few posts on the main page.
- Only uses semantic html tags, so it feels pretty modern.
- Maybe you you think people will click on social media icons? Yeah, probably not so this theme doesn't have them.
- Uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) as the main font making it very accessible and easy to read.
- Some themes have pagination for articles, thinking that very productive people will write a bazillion articles and require it. Obviously that is not the case with this theme.
- The best way to consume blog content is still with an RSS feeder so the RSS feed shows the full article.
